# PasswordGenerator

For this assignment, I used JavaScript code to create a password generator application. Through a series of prompts and confirms, the user is asked how long they would like the password to be and what characters they would like to include. I assigned corresponding variables based upon the input, and created conditional statements to account for each request. Finally, I used the generatePassword function to display the randomly generated password in the text box.
